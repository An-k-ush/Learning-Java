# Learning-Java
Started on 14th June 2023
Gotta learn the Boilerplate code(Tho it feels very weird as I have done Python in the past)
Finished all the basics like conditionals, loops etc. on 18th of June.
Started Functions on 19th June.
Done some pattern question on 20th and 21st.(it took me nearly half an hour to do Butterfly pattern.)
On 22 I revise some previous concepts like type casting as it was starting to fade away.
Day 10th of Journey to learn Java. 
I started my first Data Structure-- Array
On 26th June Finished basics of Array and practice some questions. Learnt Kadane's algo and made it work for only -ve integers myself.
On 27th June I tried Trapped Rainwater question, got stuck and took a hint. Completed it (Felt very proud).
on the same day also done Best_time_to_buy&sell_stocks question. Tho my code Time complexity was not so good. So I saw the best solution and took a note of it.
On 28th Started Sorting. Also posting this on my github page.
(Going to keep updating it.)
